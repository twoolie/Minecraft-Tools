Stuff to implement

-- Intercept map chunks, draw a map for the client

-- Intercept time packets, modify to client (always daytime)
	-- done

-- Find other clients

-- teleport to areas / other clients regardless of server support

-- build blocks in other spots (is this possible?)

-- instant mining

-- clear area around

-- insert fences around other players

THIS IS A TEST


Archived:

Done:

-- display your position, support "GPS" waypoints
	-- for spawn only, for now
		-- done

Can't do:

-- Intercept / send "set inventory / get inventory" packets
	-- we can fake "add to inventory" packets
	-- can't do this any more
